**Assignment 3: Reading json data from a web page**

On the website of the New York Times: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/28/us/covid-deaths.html?referrer=masthead>

We find a figure showing the relationship between vaccination rates and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the various states in the US.

# Task 1

# 

# Task 2

```{r}



summary(lm(deaths_per_100k ~ fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, data = df))


```

This gives us a coefficient that shows us that it estimates a -0.37 per per x, value this tells us that there would be 0.37 less in deaths per 100 000 for every 1% increase in vaccine coverage.

The intercept tells us that it would be roughly 31.15 deaths per 100 000 if there were no one vaccinated.

Finally i made this using plotly.
