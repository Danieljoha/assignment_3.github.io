**Assignment 3: Reading json data from a web page**

On the website of the New York Times: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/28/us/covid-deaths.html?referrer=masthead>

We find a figure showing the relationship between vaccination rates and the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the various states in the US.

# Task 1

```{r}
rm (list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
df <-fromJSON("https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2021/12/20/us-coronavirus-deaths-2021/ff0adde21623e111d8ce103fedecf7ffc7906264/scatter.json")

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(stateabb = state.abb[match(name, state.name)])

df[9, 7] = "D.C"


df <- df %>% 
  rename("Fully vaccinated % of pop" = fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, 
         "Deaths per 100 000" = deaths_per_100k) #Doing this to make the interactive plot easier
```

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=9, fig.cap="Source: [New York Times database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) of reports from state and local health agencies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • Notes: Chart shows deaths reported since universal vaccine eligibility on April 19, 2021. Vaccination rate is the percentage of the total population fully vaccinated as of Dec. 20, 2021."}



p <- df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = `Fully vaccinated % of pop`, y = `Deaths per 100 000`)) + 
  
  geom_point(color= "#6b9d92", fill = "#9abdb5", size=3) + 
  
  geom_text(aes(label = stateabb),hjust=0.4, vjust=-0.5, size = 3) +
  
  labs(title = "Covid-19 deaths since universal adult vaccine eligibility compared with 
       vaccination rates",
       y = " Average monthly deaths per 100 000",
       x = "Share of total population fully vaccinated") +
  
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = scales::percent, 
    limits=c(0.45, 0.80),
    breaks=seq(0.45, 0.80, by = 0.05),
    expand = c(0,0)) + 
  
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,20),
                     expand = c(0,0))+
  
  theme_bw()+
  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size=14, vjust=3, 
                                  face = "bold", hjust=0.4),
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "gray50", linetype="dotted", size=0.5),
    axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 1.023, angle=0, size=8,
                                margin=margin(l=15,r=-150)))





p2 <- p +  annotate("text", x=0.57, y=18, 
           label= "Lower vaccination rate, \nhigher death rate") +


  geom_segment(x=0.545, xend=0.53, y= 18.5, yend=19.37, arrow=arrow(type="closed"),color="black", lwd=1.5) +
  
  
  annotate("text", x=0.74, y=10, 
          label= "Higher vaccination rate,\nlower death rate") +
  
  geom_segment(x=0.74, xend=0.755, y= 9.5, yend=8.63, arrow=arrow(type="closed"),color="black", lwd=1.5)


p2
```

# 

# Task 2

```{r}



summary(lm(`Deaths per 100 000` ~ `Fully vaccinated % of pop`, data = df))


```

This gives us a coefficient that shows us that it estimates a -36.663 per per x, value this tells us that there would be 36.663 less in deaths per 100 000 for every 1% increase in vaccine coverage.

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=9}



p2 + geom_smooth(method = lm, se=FALSE)
```

Finally i made this using plotly.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.cap="Source: [New York Times database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html) of reports from state and local health agencies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention • Notes: Chart shows deaths reported since universal vaccine eligibility on April 19, 2021. Vaccination rate is the percentage of the total population fully vaccinated as of Dec. 20, 2021."}




annoyingtoworkwith <- ggplotly(p)

annoyingtoworkwith <- layout(
  annoyingtoworkwith,
  title = list("<b>Covid-19 deaths since universal adult vaccine eligibility compared with
               vaccination rates</b>", font=list(size=12)),

  margin = list(l=80, r=50, b=50, t=80))

```
